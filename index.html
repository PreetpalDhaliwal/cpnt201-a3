  <h1>Basketball</h1>
  <p>Basketball is a popular sport in this day and age. It was created
    by James Naismith. The game is played between two teams, each
    team has about 20-30 players. On the court, only 5 players from each
    team are allowed to play and switch with eachother during timeouts.
    The goal is to score more points than the opposing team by shooting
    the basketball into the hoop. Although the sport can be played indoors
    and outdoors, professional basketball is played indoors.
